One of 5 invited student talks at a summer school. Very preliminary.

<b>Abstract:</b>

Individual foraging strategy, comprising spatial navigation, memory, and decision-making, can be seen as
a local solution to a common problem: acquiring patchily distributed resources in a dynamic environment.
In an animal group, this computation increases in complexity, requiring an individual to sense both spatial
as well as social factors. How the involved representation develops to balance these two sensory inputs
has received little attention. I seek to demonstrate, through simulating and evolving agents equipped with
visual, memory, and decision-making neural network modules, that fundamental dynamical manifolds
emerge in order to coordinate environmental and social features with local food distribution, however with
increasingly signiScant attention to the latter in social groups as individuals can leverage collective
computation to forage more effectively.
